<!-- The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags are to give more information about the code and
topic of what the code is describing. They are used to clearly describe the meaning of
code to both the browser and the developer. Some semantic code that I have learned to be
very useful is <div> and <table>. <div> allows you to seperate or divide your code into
sections so you know exactly where everything is. Also I did not know how much I liked to
create tables til I learned how to make one with <table>.

First your computer which is also known as the client reaches out to the other computer which
is known as the server. Your client asks the server for the information and documents that it
wants in the form of computer to computer conversation. This conversation is also known as
HTTP which stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. What your client and server send back to
each other are known as HTTP requests in order to exchange information. These are made so
quickly that we won't be able to read this in real time. After your client and server
exchange the necessary amount of requests your browser renders the code and information
onto a single readable document.

The thing that I learned about Sublime in this challenge was how to create snippets of
code so I won't have to type out the basics everytime I am starting a webpage. I will most
definitely create more handy snippets later because this makes things easier.

There was not really a concept that was too difficult in this challenge except for semantics
which is something that I am grasping more and more as I use it. I find myself understanding
more about it as the week went on and the challenges got harder and harder. The pace of 
these weeks are refreshing and I am excited to start the next week. -->
