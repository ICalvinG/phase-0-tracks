## 3. What is a VPS (virtual private server)? What are the advantages?
A VPS is a type of web hosting server that hosts in a main physical server and dividing that into multiple virtual servers. Each part that is divided is capable of performing independent operations with it's own operating system. The advantages of using a VPS is that the cost is much less than using a dedicated server. Being able to divide the server into other capable servers allows you to maximize workflow and not disturb anyone else on your server. Also in terms of security a VPS has a high security level because since every individual server is seperated, it is very difficult for another server to invade the security.

## 4. Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
