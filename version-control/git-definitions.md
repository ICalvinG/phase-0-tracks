# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? Version control is a tool that allows you to track progress, review and revert changes, and create backups in your code. It is useful because it allows you to see all the changes that are made to a file and by whom they were made by. This gives you the chance to review the change and revert it if you need to. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is just a copy of your project that you can work on. The reason for using one is that it gives you more room for error because you would not be hurting your master branch if you were to make a mistake. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit is a save point in Git. A good commit message describes what and why the change was made.
* What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict is when your current branch and the branch you want to merge into have commits that are different.
